    "### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python code should implement Craig Reynolds's Boids flocking model using the Mesa framework for agent-based modelling. The Boids model simulates the collective motion of entities, resembling the flocking behaviour observed in birds, fish, and other social animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual agents, called Boids, should navigate a two-dimensional space while adhering to three key behaviours: cohesion (moving towards neighbouring agents), separation (avoiding collisions with nearby agents), and alignment (matching the direction of neighbouring agents). These behaviours should be controlled by parameters such as vision range and relative importance factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Boid` class should represent a single agent, defining its attributes and behaviours, while the `BoidFlockers` class should encapsulate the entire model, including agent creation, space definition, and scheduling of agent actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model should utilize a continuous space and a random activation schedule. The continuous space should allow Boids to move smoothly within a defined two-dimensional area, while the random activation schedule should randomly select agents for execution at each step, ensuring fair and unbiased updates across the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "By simulating the interactions between Boids within this space and schedule, the code should demonstrate emergent flocking behaviour, illustrating how simple rules at the individual level can lead to complex collective patterns at the group level."
