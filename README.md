# Workshop: Introduction to Mesa

This workshop serves as an introductory guide to using Mesa for the course *CM0079 Modelation and simulation III*, a Python library for agent-based modeling. Through a series of tutorials, participants will gain hands-on experience in creating, running, and analyzing agent-based models using Mesa's intuitive framework.

The workshop will cover fundamental concepts of agent-based modeling, including the creation of agents, the definition of model behaviors, data collection and analysis, batch running for parameter exploration as well as visualiztion. Participants will learn how to leverage Mesa's features to build and simulate complex systems, enabling them to explore emergent phenomena and study real-world scenarios.

No prior experience in agent-based modeling or Mesa is required to attend this workshop. Participants will leave with a basic understanding of Mesa's capabilities and the ability to apply agent-based modeling techniques to their own research or projects.

**Workshop Outline:**
1. Creating Agents and Models
2. Defining Model Behaviors
3. Data Collection and Analysis
4. Batch Running and Parameter Exploration
5. Visualization
