# Workshop: Introduction to Mesa

This workshop, designed for the course *CM0079 Modelation and Simulation III*, offers an introductory exploration of Mesa, a Python library for agent-based modeling. Through a series of tutorials, participants will gain hands-on experience in creating, running, and analyzing agent-based models using Mesa's intuitive framework.

It covers the fundamental concepts of agent-based modeling, including the creation of agents, the definition of model behaviors, data collection and analysis, batch running for parameter exploration, and visualization. Participants will learn how to leverage Mesa's features to build and simulate complex systems, enabling them to explore emergent phenomena and study real-world scenarios.

By the end of the workshop, attendees will possess a foundational understanding of Mesa's functionalities and the skills necessary to apply agent-based modeling techniques to their respective research or projects.
